They can use movement actions but not reactions or standard actions This does not protect a character from death. They can be killed normally, and this power cannot bring back a dead character. Once the power takes effect, the target does not have to remain within the character's reach. When the effect ends if the target has 0 Health or less, they become unconscious If the target's Health rises above 0 at any poist, this power automatically ends."
