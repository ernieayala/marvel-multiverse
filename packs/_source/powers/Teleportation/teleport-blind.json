Outside of combat, they can teleport up to 100 times their rank in spaces away. If the character teleports into something solid, they are automatically pushed out of it but take damage from the disruption equal to a standard action check. The damage multiplier is 1 for every space they must move to reach a clear area. If this kills them, their body is trapped inside the material they teleported into."
