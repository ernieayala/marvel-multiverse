The character can also use this spell to push away smoke, mist or fog. If such a thing was created by a power, the character makes an Ego check with an edge against the Ego defense of the opposing controller. On a success, the controller's power ends. On a Fantastic success, the controller is knocked prone. Additionally, the Winds of Watoomb can be used to reinforce the Shield of the Seraphim. The character can transfer any Health damage that gets through the Shield of the Seraphim's protection to their Focus instead, leaving the Shield of the Seraphim intact."
