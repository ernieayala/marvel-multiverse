Anyone that comes into contact with it, though, takes regular damage with a damage multiplier equal to the character's rank. On a Fantastic success, it inflicts regular Health damage and regular Focus damage instead. The character controls the vehicle by will, as long as it is within 20 spaces times the character's rank. They use their Ego for all checks to operate it, and they get an edge on all such checks. The vehicle's speed doubles. It can climb walls at this speed and can even make jumps at that same speed."
