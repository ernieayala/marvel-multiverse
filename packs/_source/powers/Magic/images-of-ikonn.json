The duplicates look and sound exactly like the original and are under the character's complete control. They start in the same space as the character and instantly move into any open space around them, up to 2 spaces away, during which time the character can swap places with any of the duplicates. If the character is duplicating themselves, the character's player should secretly record which one is the actual character. The duplicates can move up to 10 spaces away from the character, and they can pretend to attack (and miss) opponents. Any attack that hits a duplicate instantly removes it. If the character successfully attacks someone or does something else to make the truth evident, the illusion ends. This spell can also be used to see through someone else's illusion. When used in this way, it gives the character a double edge on their Ego check."
