On a success, the target takes regular Health damage. On a Fantastic success, the target is grabbed and paralyzed too. If a target is grabbed by the hellfire chains, on each subsequent round, the character can make an Ego check against the target's Resilience Resilience defense to inflict regular Health damage and regular Focus damage. Breaking free from the hellfire chains requires a Melee check with a target number of 20."
