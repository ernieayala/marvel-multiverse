People the character has phased remain tangible to each other. If the target does not wish to be phased, the character must grab them first. When contact is broken, the phasing for those no longer in contact with the character (even indirectly) ends. If a person is inside something when they stop phasing, they are automatically pushed out of it but take damage from the disruption equal to a standard action check. The damage multiplier is 1 for every space they must move to reach a clear area. If this kills them, their body is trapped inside the material they were phased into."
