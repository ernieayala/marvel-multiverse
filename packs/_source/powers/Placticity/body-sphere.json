Those inside the sphere gain Health Damage Reduction 3 against outside attacks, but they cannot move on their own until the character releases them. Alternatively, if the attacker is within the character's reach, the character can make an Agility check against the target's Agility defense. On a success, the character envelops the attacker, grabbing them. On a Fantastic success, the character closes the sphere enough to pin the attacker too."
