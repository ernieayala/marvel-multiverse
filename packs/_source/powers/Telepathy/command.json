On a success, the target complies with the order. On a Fantastic success, the character gains an edge the next time they use this power against this same target. The command must be something that can be completed in a single action. If it involves harming someone, the character has trouble on the check. If it would cause the target to harm themselves, the character has double trouble on the check."
