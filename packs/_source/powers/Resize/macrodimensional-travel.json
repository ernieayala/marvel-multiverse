Note that this is something that most characters would rarely want to do, as it removes them entirely from their regular universe and places them in a dimension in which the rules of time and space work differently. An hour in the Macroverse, for example, is roughly equivalent to a month in a regular universe. A trip to the Overspace is too overwhelming for most minds to handle."
