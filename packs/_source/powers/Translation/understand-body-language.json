If they already know any other version of the culture's language, they have an edge. On a success, they understand and can emulate the body language On a Fantastic success, they permanently understand and can use it and never need to make a check for it again.

With such species, understanding their body language allows the character to understand more than the target's words might communicate, such as whether a person is aggressive, shy, anxious reckless and so on."
