On a success, the character knows if the communicator is lying. On a Fantastic success, they also know (if possible) why the communicator is lying This power does not allow the character to know the truth, although they may be able to figure it out by detecting lies. Also, It only works on communicators who know they are lying. If they believe what they are saying-even if it is wrong-no lie can be detected."
