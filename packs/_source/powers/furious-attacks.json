Make a single Melee check and compare it to the targets' Melee defenses. For these attacks, add 1+ to the character's Melee damage bonus for every 2 points of Focus they spend. On a success, an affected target takes half that total damage. On a Fantastic success, an affected target takes full damage and suffers the weapon's special effect."
