When they lose all their Health, their form loses its cohesion and falls apart. When they have at least 1 Health—which they can gain back over time, normally— they can re-form. If the character wishes to use their elemental body in unusual ways, they should pick Plasticity powers. If they wish to be able to be fully human at times, they should take the Shape-Shift power."
