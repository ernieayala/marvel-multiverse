    "description": "The character is a citizen of the mutant nation of Krakoa. Upon the founding of Krakoa as a nation, citizenship was granted automatically to all Earth-born mutants. At the height of that nation's power. if a Krakoan was killed, the Five-a group of powerful mutants-could work together to resurrect that mutant in a cloned body, with most of their memories intact. If killed in Otherworld, the character could still be resurrected but they would be changed in unpredictable ways. How this might affect the character is up to the Narrator. In the current status quo, Krakoa has fallen. Mutants no longer automatically have access to the Krakoan gates or resurrection by the Five. Characters who once lived on Krakoa might retain this tag, though to represent their attachment to the mutant homeland.",
