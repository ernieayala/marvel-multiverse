    "description": "In rare cases a mutant can experience a secondary mutation at some point after their original mutaton. A good example is Emma Frost. who started out as a fairly straightforward telepath had later gained a secondary mutation that allowed her to turn into a living diamond. This is not a new origin but a new tag that serves as an extenson of the regular Mutant origin. Only characters with the Mutant origin can have a secondary mutation. If a character has this tag it means that they once had a lower rank cap and broke through it. For example they might have been at Rank 3 for years and then gained a secondary mutation that let them eventually rise to Rank 5. When an existing character gains this tag, they advance to the next rank Thus a character can take it only after they have had enough adventures thut they would normally be able to rank up but cannot because of their rank cap. Taking this tag means they can add a single rank, and if their new rank cap allows further growth, they can play to gain more ranks as normal",
