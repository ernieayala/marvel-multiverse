In their natural form, they have green skin, red or green eyes, pointed ears and furrowed chins. They sprang from the planet Skrullos in the Andromeda Galaxy. The original Skrulls could not shape-shift, but the Celestials experimented on them to form Eternal Skrulls and Deviant Skrulls, much like they did with humans on Earth. The Deviant Skrulls became the dominant form of the species, driving the originals to extinction.",
