    "description": "The character's powers arose from a scientific experiment or accident that's hardâ€”if not impossible-to reproduce. Often, they had the latent genetic potential to develop powers and were somehow exposed to the right triggers-which would have likely killed most other people. These kinds of characters are sometimes called mutates. The difference between a mutate and a mutant is that a mutant's powers come to them naturally, but a mutate's powers require a triggering incident that might never happen. In this sense, Inhumans are all mutates who share a gene with a known trigger: the Terrigen Mist.",
