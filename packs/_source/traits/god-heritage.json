    "description": "The character—or at least one of their ancestors—is a god. Pick something that they are the god of. They don’t have to be a god that most people have heard of. In fact, they can be the god of something entirely new. However, they cannot generally be the god of something that’s already been claimed by someone else in their pantheon. Other gods are often jealous of their positions and take issue with such rivals. The character has an edge when dealing with something that they are the god of."
