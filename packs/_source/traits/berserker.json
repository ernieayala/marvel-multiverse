    "description": "The character often loses control of their temper. Any time they take physical damape, they must make an Ego check with n TH equal to the amount of damage done. 1f they fail, they go berserk and must charge at full speed inte combat with the enemy who hurt them. Being berserk gives the character an edge on all close attncks ond adds +2 to their Melee, Resilience and Ego defenses. However, it takes -2 from their Agllity defense, and they cannot use ranged weapons.If the character defeats the enemy who hurt them, they must then charge to attack the next clesest foe, Attheend of the character's turn, they lose S Focus. When their Focus is reduced to the point that the character could not voluntarily spend any maore Focus—or il there are no enemies in sipht—the berserk state automatically ends."
